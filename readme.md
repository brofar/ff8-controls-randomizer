# Controls Randomizer

Randomizes controller controls while playing FF8 by reading and shuffling the control mapping in the game's memory while you play.
Does not affect keyboard controls/mapping.

## Options

### Full Random
* OFF: Directional controls and buttons are randomized in separate pools.
* ON: Everything is randomized in the same pool.

### Randomize on map change instead of timer
* OFF: Performs the randomization on a timed interval (set by the user)
* ON: Performs the randomization whenever the party changes screens in game

Restores your original controller configuration when you click stop, so do that before quitting the game or the randomizer.
